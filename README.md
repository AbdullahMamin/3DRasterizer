# 3DRasterizer
This is a 3D rasterizer I wrote using C and SDL2.

## Build
This project depends on the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries, simply compile all sources and link against the libraries. The makefile provided works on linux and may need slight changes to work on other platforms.


## Usage
Simple execute and use the WASD keys to move around, Q and E to change altitude, R to reset the camera, and the mouse to move the camera.
